 Response to @LindseyGrahamSC:
 I hear @JoeNBC of rapidly fading @Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win. Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed, then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight! Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now. Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says, she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad! Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party. Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters! @Ausbiz:  Many would say that you are the only talented person running for the top job this time! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain So many great endorsements yesterday, except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Governor Rick Perry said Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency I've ever seen. Thank you Rick! Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton, who wants to destroy all miners, I want wages to go up in America. We will do so by bringing back jobs! Thank you West Virginia. Let's keep it going. Go out and vote on Tuesday - we will win big. #Trump2016 Can you believe Crooked Hillary said, We are going to put a whole lot of coal miners&coal companies out of business. She then apologized. Join me tomorrow! #Trump2016

 Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates & otherwise. He should show them, & run as an Independent. Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!   I will be interviewed by @BretBaier @SpecialReport at 6pm ET tonight @FoxNews Many reports that I will be attending the Alvarez/Khan fight this weekend in Vegas. Totally untrue! Unfortunately I have other plans. Join me in Charleston, WV - tomorrow!  I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy! I will be interviewed on @TODAYshow and Good Morning America at 7:00 A.M. I will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 6:15 A.M. Enjoy! I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie! What a great evening we had. So interesting that Sanders beat Crooked Hillary. The dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him! .@oreillyfactor  Please correct, I WON Virginia! Thank you Indiana, we were just projected to be the winner. We have won in every category. You are very special people-I will never forget! Thank you Indiana! #Trump2016
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain  Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will, and must, win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money Wow, Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Everybody is talking about the protesters burning the American flags and proudly waving Mexican flags. I want America First - so do voters! Gov Mike Pence has just stated that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on Hoosier jobs, and he thanks me! I will bring back jobs to USA. Crooked Hillary Clinton said she is used to dealing with men who get off the reservation. Actually, she has done poorly with such men! I will be interviewed on @CNN  @NewDay  at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy!

I am on @FoxNewsSunday with Chris Wallace- his 20th year anniversary with #FNS, throughout the day. Enjoy!  Will be in Terre Haute, Indiana in a short while -- big rally! See you soon! I watched Sen. Graham @FaceTheNation. Why don't they say that I ran him out of the race like a little boy, and in the end he had no support? Thank you Indiana! #Trump2016  I will be in Indiana on Sunday and Monday at four MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN rallies. See you there! Thank you @MikeOzanian for the nice comments on @FoxNews today. Great job! Trump locks down Delaware GOP delegates. #Trump2016 #MAGA 
 The economy is bad and getting worse-almost ZERO growth this quarter. Nobody can beat me on the economy and jobs. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN @LexingtonBobby: @FoxNews @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump  The protesters in California were thugs and criminals. Many are professionals. They should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement! .@AC360  Anderson, so amazing. Your mother is, and always has been, an incredible woman! We are now at 1001 delegates. We will win on the first ballot and are not wasting time and effort on other ballots because system is rigged! Thank you Indiana! #Trump2016  Crooked Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency, is also one of the all time great enablers! Wow, the ridiculous deal made between Lyin'Ted Cruz and 1 for 42 John Kasich has just blown up. What a dumb deal - dead on arrival! Thank you Costa Mesa, California! 31,000 people tonight with thousands turned away.

 So many false and phony T.V. commercials being broadcast in Indiana. Reminds me of Florida where thousands were put up-I won in a landslide! I will be in Evansville, Indiana, with the great Bobby Knight who last night endorsed me at 12:00 this afternoon. See you there! Lyin' Ted Cruz, who can never beat Hillary Clinton and has NO path to victory, has chosen a V.P.candidate who failed badly in her own effort I will be interviewed on the @TODAYshow at 7:00 A.M. this morning. Enjoy! Thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech. I will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics! @AnnetteJeanne: I cried when they said you made a clean sweep of all 5 states. I was SO HAPPY! I really adore you Mr. Trump, so much. Getting the strong endorsement of the great coach, Bobby Knight, has been a highlight of my stay in Indiana. Big speech tomorrow with Bobby! I am in Indiana where we just had a great rally. Fantastic people! Staying at a Holiday Inn Express - new and clean, not bad! Thank you Laura!   Thank you for the endorsement, Coach Bobby Knight! I will never forget it!

  On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night! Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work. Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses. Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up collusion in a two on one. Shows weakness! Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad! Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION! I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant! @DiamondandSilk: .@DonaldJTrumpJr awesome job on @CNNSotu. DonaldTrump has integrity & he refuses 2 play the game call Delegate Bribery @newtgingrich: #NYPrimary turned Trump from frontrunner into presumptive #GOP nominee   I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally. Things are looking good for Tuesday! .@AndreBauer  Great job and advice on @CNN  @jaketapper  Thank you! .@Borisep was great on @JudgeJeanine tonight. Very smart commentary that will prove to be correct! As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads, he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton. I will win! I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut. Looking for a big vote on Tuesday! Congratulations to @seanhannity on his great ratings and ratings increase as reported by the @AP today. Amazing job!

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
 I met Prince on numerous occasions. He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. He will be greatly missed! Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted. Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify! Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out! I will be doing the @TODAYshow with my wife, Melania, and the rest of my family in a major Town Hall. Hopefully, it will be fun! Enjoy.7A.M. Thank you Maryland- what a great way to conclude the day! Will be back soon. #Trump2016   We are going to bring steel and manufacturing back to Indiana! Had a meeting with the terrific @GovPenceIN of Indiana. So excited to campaign in his wonderful state!

 Lyin’ Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help. So many New Yorkers devastated. Cruz hates New York! New York, we will make America great again!  Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him Lyin' Ted Cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-I am millions of VOTES ahead! Hillary would destroy him & K @DiamondandSilk: .@realDonaldTrump is who we need 2 fix this corrupted, rigged system. 4 no Profit, Under budget & ahead of schedule. Thank you for today's endorsement, New York Veteran Police Association! 
#NewYorkValues   Thank you, California! Will see you soon! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
  I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie! Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun! Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes I am millions ahead of him so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work! Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system, I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him. I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning, Staten Island. Big crowd, will be fun! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #NYPrimary

Great anger - totally unfair! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
 I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign. Bad system! The @nytimes purposely covers me so inaccurately.

 Can you believe that Ted Cruz, who has been killing our country on trade for so long, just put out a Wisconsin ad talking about trade? We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States!  My new radio ad, airing today in Wisconsin! See you soon!
#WIPrimary #Trump2016 
 Does anybody like Lyin' Ted?  For the 1st time in American history, America’s 16,500 border patrol agents have issue a presidential primary endorsement—me! Thank you. The National Border Patrol Council NBPC said that our open border is the biggest physical & economic threat facing the American people! The Club For Growth said in their ad that 465 delegates Cruz plus 143 delegates Kasich is more than my 739 delegates. Try again! The Club For Growth,which asked me for $1,000,000 in an extortion attempt, just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math.What a dumb group! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
  THANK YOU, NEW YORK! #Trump2016  THANK YOU, AMERICA! #Trump2016

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
  .@DavidGregory got thrown off of TV by NBC, fired like a dog! Now he is on @CNN being nasty to me. Not nice! Final #'s just announced in the GREAT State of MO. TRUMP WINS! New certified #'s show a 365 vote increase for me- @ least 12 more delegates! Thank you! #Trump2016  Trump defends campaign manager charged for bruising a reporter:
 Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
 Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand??  This was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility, she changed her tune.  Victory press conference was over. 
Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges?  Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened, that is before she found out the episode was on tape? Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there! How come the @TODAYshow & @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz? I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich, and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC. Wow, @CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really one-sided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight! We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games, we must be smart, tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN & MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN! Lyin' Ted, I have already beaten you in all debates, and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs & illegal imm! Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak & losing big, so now he wants to debate again. But, according to Drudge,Time and on-line polls, I have won all debates After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker and Jeb, Rand, Marco and all others in the Presidential Primaries, no way he would ever endorse me! @PaulaDuvall2:  Cruz will say anything that is contrary to what you have to say. If you're for Motherhood, he'll be against it! Just released that international gangs are all over our cities. This will end when I am President! @wolfblitzer:  Campaign-to-date popular GOP totals: @realDonaldTrump 7,546,980; @tedcruz 5,481,737; @JohnKasich 2,724,749 A BIG DIFFERENCE Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism, as well as current mission, but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE, a must! A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American. When will our so-called leaders ever learn! Kirsten Powers: Anti- Trump Operative was Aggressively Shopping Cruz Story 
via the Gateway Pundit:  @nellalda: @realDonaldTrump We stand by Trump 100%  Thank you! I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30. Things are looking good, had a great Easter-look forward to spending the week in Wisconsin! @VictorConkle: #WIPrimary @realDonaldTrump will defeat ISIS and #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  The United States cannot continue to make such bad, one-sided trade deals. There are only so many jobs we can give up. No more! See Lyin' Ted, even the @DailyBeast no fan of mine says this story came from Rubio, not Trump!  Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be, I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming Why can't the pundits be honest? Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great!  JOBS! Another radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead,400 injured. I alone can solve Happy Easter to all, have a great day! My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive and unfair for the U.S. are now, finally, receiving plaudits! Wow, sleepy eyes @chucktodd is at it again. He is do totally biased. The things I am saying are correct. - far better vision than the others I am interviewed on This Week on @ABC this morning. Enjoy! Remember, I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters, I am not bought like others! Don't believe the @FoxNews Polls, they are just another phony hit job on me. I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election. Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S., jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out! Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story! The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women, when they know that it is just the opposite! The media is so after me on women  Wow, this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump! @pattiandsammi: @gullakhta99 @realDonaldTrump @Tytan01 @CNN WOMEN LOVE TRUMP. TRUMP'S EXECS PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE. #WOMEN4TRUMP @Tytan01: Dear @CNN, after doing a quick Google & Twitter search there are over 15,000 women's groups supporting DonaldTrump. Stop Lying. @SpartanMaker:  Let me help you Trumpophobes with math: Trump: $10.3B-$1.2M 74' equity/1.2M = 858,233%. S&P: 1314.5% #Derp @stanColtrane: Turns out @glennbeck was wrong. @realDonaldTrump had nothing to do with it  @stanColtrane: Turns out @glennbeck was wrong. @realDonaldTrump had nothing to do with it  @theAgeofLeo: Your instincts on foreign policy & terrorism have been better than all of these so called experienced politicians combined. Top suspect in Paris massacre, Salah Abdeslam, who also knew of the Brussels attack, is no longer talking. Weak leaders, ridiculous laws! @11phenomenon: #LyingTed blames @realDonaldTrump for so many things I am starting to think he is having a mental health crisis. Wow, just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. How am I still number one - by a lot? I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania, he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence, Lyin' Ted! Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lost-monster story! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  Endorsements for Lyin' Ted Cruz-  @NeilTurner_: @realDonaldTrump Cruz & Rubio are scared! WATCH ->   Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! So sad! Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe. Also, many in U.S.  I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem! @Doctor_S_Freud:  @TheView They're all brain-dead puppets with skeletons in their closet. I say you go on and destroy them all A dead show Explain how the women on The View, which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left, ever got their jobs. @abc is wasting time .@TheView T.V. show, which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air, is constantly asking me to go on. I TELL THEM NO Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE, I WILL SOLVE - AND FAST! @TimVincent56:  @LindseyGrahamSC Talkers think about the future, Doers are already building it #VoteTrump2016  It is amazing how often I am right, only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration, take the oil, build the wall, Muslims, NATO! Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a hell hole and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. I was so right! These politicians like Cruz and Graham, who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years, do nothing to make things better! .@LindseyGrahamSC and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION! Both talk about ISIS, do nothing! It is amazing how @LindseyGrahamSC gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly ZERO in his pres run! @missi51: .@realDonaldTrump thank God is not a politician, but he's one heck of a fighter who will fight for us, the people. We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate, and the time is now! N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on! @Don_Vito_08: A picture is worth a thousand words @realDonaldTrump  #LyingTed #NeverCruz  @MELANIATRUMP  @Kj11100Me: @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump will be greater  president than Ragan. Trump will set the button for morality,Christianity. @tcsorr: @jphilman0206 @realDonaldTrump self-funded and media loves him. Not beholden to masters like @tedcruz. Who owns Ted? @DebraRakestraw:  You have over 2M followers more than than @HillaryClinton. This says something about how America feels. #Trump2016 🇺🇸 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! I want to thank @RealSheriffJoe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win. Could not have done it without you Joe! While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates, it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race! I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $150,000,000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first! I will be the best by far in fighting terror. I’m the only one that was right from the beginning, & now Lyin’ Ted & others are copying me. Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. She’s been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are! Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates, Lyin’ Ted Cruz. Honestly, I can’t blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion! Lyin’ Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from Michael Douglas— just another dishonest politician. Thank you, Arizona! #Trump2016
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain
  Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted! Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November, paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices! Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you, I will never forget! Thank you, Arizona! #Trump2016
#WesternTuesday #TrumpTrain  Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way! Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife! Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately & get home to Washington- where a #POTUS, under a serious emergency belongs! Obama, and all others, have been so weak, and so politically correct, that terror groups are forming and getting stronger! Shame. #UtahCaucus message from @IvankaTrump! #UTCaucus
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
 #ArizonaPrimary message from @IvankaTrump! #AZPrimary #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
 #VoteTrump video: 
#AZPrimary #ArizonaPrimary #UtahCaucus #UTCaucus #AmericanSamoa  My heart & prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible #Brussels tragedy. This madness must be stopped, and I will stop it. Watch this clip from earlier this year. Time & time again I have been right about terrorism. It’s time to get tough!  I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and it’s not even close. Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba, especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly! Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore, it is from a different world! U.S. must be vigilant and smart! @MyPresidentme: Here's Trump #AIPAC2016 in case anyone missed it. It is a must watch.  @BarronG510: @realDonaldTrump The media is corrupt! We The People are fighting with you. Wow, President Obama just landed in Cuba, a big deal, and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him. He greeted Pope and others. No respect Big Republican Dinner tonight at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. I will be there! @gamzorz:  @megynkelly Dont worry Trump, They are losing thousands of viewers and money. Roger Ailes will be telling Megyn to stop So the highly overrated anchor, @megynkelly, is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show, but I can't fight back? Wrong! The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday, delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours, and the media blames my supporters! Why is it that the horrendous protesters, who scream, curse punch, shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES,  are never blamed by media? SAD! Will be interviewed on @ThisWeekABC this morning. Enjoy! @GStephanopoulos: What’s @realDonaldTrump's strategy to secure the GOP nomination? I’ll talk to the Republican front-runner. @ThisWeekABC. The rallies in Utah and Arizona were great! Tremendous crowds and spirit. Just returned but will be going back soon. @jojo2foxy: TRUMP IS NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING OR ANYONE - THAT'S THE PRESIDENT USA NEEDS TO UNITE US & KNOCK THE SOCKS OFF OUR ENEMIES! THANK YOU ARIZONA!

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain  Wow, @CNN ratings are up 75% because it's all Trump, all the time. The networks are making a fortune off of me! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Great to be back in Arizona!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016  If crazy @megynkelly didn't cover me so much on her terrible show, her ratings would totally tank. She is so average in so many ways! Crazy @megynkelly says I don't won't go on her show and she still gets good ratings. But almost all of her shows are negative hits on me! @saneplanet: after tonight it is clear! Utah is #TrumpCountry  #Utah #Mormon #UtahPrimary #Utah4Trump  @TeamTrumpAZ: Check out HANNITY EXCLUSIVE EVENT WITH TRUMP IN PHOENIX, AZ  @Eventbrite @DonaldJTrumpJr: Honored to be in #Utah with retired General Robert C. Oaks. We are so thankful for his support and endorsement here in SLC @Ma1973sk: Actually, no @FoxNews, @megynkelly has a sick obsession with Trump. Every day, every show, trashing, negative, hate. @AshleyEdam: It's great to see supporters like you along the way...watching Americans come together the past 8 months #voteTrump @grammy620: 1st time I heard #Trump I said wow. I liked him! I then became a closet #Trump fan. Today? He's the ONLY 1 I will vote for! @Veteran4Trump: Vets For A Strong America Endorses Donald Trump for president; We've Endorsed Him, We Believe In Him #Trump2016 @WesleyRickard: Sheriff Joe Arpaio AZ Endorses Donald J Trump for President of the United States #AZ #UT   @cmichaeld2004: Realistic Trump Poll Numbers translate to the 70 percentile range in a two-man race. Gee, what happened to that 30% ceiling @ileanabarkus:  @nytdavidbrooks I totally agree! @nytdavidbrooks is strictly conceptual and theoretical and has NO COMMONSENSE! Thank you- New York! I love you!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016  Landing in Phoenix now. Tomorrow's events will be amazing! #Trump2016 Reading @nytdavidbrooks of the NY Times is a total waste of time, he is a clown with no awareness of the world around him- dummy! While I have never met @nytdavidbrooks of the NY Times, I consider him one of the dumbest of all pundits- he has no sense of the real world! Heading to Phoneix. Will be arriving soon. Tomorrow a big day. Tremendous crowds expected! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Watching @loudobbsnews- fantastic show! Has very interesting take on Paul Ryan. Just leaving Salt Lake City, Utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions. 
Love Utah- will be back! Why haven't they released the final Missouri victory for us yet? Could it be because Cruz's guy runs Missouri? I guess I have reached yet another ceiling  - 49.7%, with four people. My highest Reuters poll yet! Thank you!  Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets! Everybody should boycott the @megynkelly show. Never worth watching. Always a hit on Trump! She is sick, & the most overrated person on tv. Thank you Arizona- I love you! 
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016  Join me tomorrow! #Trump2016
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
 Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost! Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich & Marco Rubio, and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2 Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who choked and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me! Going to Salt Lake City, Utah, for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there - Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary Club for Growth letter- trying to extort $1,000,000.00 from me. Remember, I said- NO!  Club For Growth tried to extort $1,000,000 from me. When I said NO, they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful! With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment, my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this? .@EWErickson got fired like a dog from RedState
and now he is the one leading opposition against me. Senator @LindseyGrahamSC made horrible statements about @SenTedCruz – and then he endorsed him. No wonder nobody trusts politicians! Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0! Join us in Salt Lake City, Utah- tonight!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
 Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Who should star in a reboot of Liar Liar- Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz? Let me know.  Highly overrated & crazy @megynkelly is always complaining about Trump and yet she devotes her shows to me. Focus on others Megyn! Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio. Two more days and Ohio was mine! See you in Arizona on Friday and Saturday.  Please explain to the dummies at the @WSJ  Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won, according to Drudge etc., all 11 of them! .@WSJ is bad at math. The good news is, nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore, especially me! .@WSJ Editorial says Clinton primary vote total is 8,646,551.Trump's is 7,533,692-a knock. But she had only 3 opponents-I had 16.Apologize The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem! Crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that  @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me - yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough! Great news that @FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question? I beat Cruz debating Crazy @megynkelly supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night. Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. Ted can't win! Stuart Stevens, the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss, is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump. Sad! I will be interviewed on The O'Reilly Factor this evening at 8 pm on the Fox News Channel. @oreillyfactor Thank you, Missouri! #Trump2016  Wow, just won Missouri! I am making a big speech the night of the @FoxNews debate, but I wish everyone well. Yesterday was a big day for me with 5 wins! Thank you to the Governor of Florida, Rick Scott, for your endorsement. I greatly appreciate your support! In the last 2 weeks, I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida & I won in a massive landslide.The establishment should save their $$! Yesterday was amazing—5 victories.  Lyin’ Ted Cruz
had zero. Things are going very well! Is this what we want for a President?  .@RepTomMarino  Great job on television this morning. Glad to have you on my side! @FoxBusiness: .@RepTomMarino: I think @realDonaldTrump can beat HillaryClinton. And I'm looking forward to Trump being president. .@pastormarkburns You were great last night and we all very much appreciate it! Thank you! I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:30 A.M. ENJOY! Will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 7:40. ENJOY! Will be interviewed on @NewDay on @CNN at 7:15 A.M. Will be interviewed on @GMA at 7:00 A.M. Big wins last night! @lucyric13835428: @realDonaldTrump @megynkelly  That's funny, I switched to other media too, can't stand her @MaryEH428: @RealBenCarson I thank God you are on board with @realDonaldTrump to help him and us #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Ty!! Thank you Marco, I agree!  I only wish my wonderful daughter Tiffany could have been with us at

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain  Can't watch Crazy Megyn anymore. Talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race. With two people, big & over! @DumpFoxNews: @FoxNews @megynkelly  If media wasn't so biased against Trump, he would've won all of the delegates. @SCNAK45: @megynkelly is trying so hard to bash @realDonaldTrump it's ridiculous Don't worry, everyone is wise to Crazy Megyn! @J_Styborski: @realDonaldTrump @gregens21 @BertShad @FoxNews @megynkelly Hayes is looking depressed as well.  @jsconlon11:  @BertShad @Foxnews @megynkelly I tried to give them a shot tonight, but they have the whole anti Trump cheerleading team. @gregens21:  @BertShad @FoxNews @megynkelly She's choking on the results! Call her justifiable Kelly. Justifying everything she says. @BertShad: Was going to watch @Foxnews for the primary results but saw @megynkelly - looks like #CNN tonight Word is that, despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads, I had a massive victory in Florida. Numbers out soon! A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false. I will bring our jobs back to the U.S., and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will sing again. In presidential voting so far, John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him, I will beat Hillary! Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico, now losing Ford and many others. Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now! Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate, until I put him down. #VoteTrump #SuperTuesday

  North Carolina lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs and Ohio lost 400,000 since 2000. Going to Mexico etc. NO MORE IF I WIN, WE WILL BRING BACK! Just in, big news- I have been declared the winner of the CNMI Rep Caucus with 72.8% of the vote! Thank you! #SuperTuesday #VoteTrump Good morning Ohio! Some additional information from my daughter, @IvankaTrump! #VoteTrump #SuperTuesday  Don't reward Mitt Romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for Kasich who voted for NAFTA, open borders etc.. Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists! I will bring our jobs back to America, fix our military and take care of our vets, end Common Core and ObamaCare, protect 2nd A, build WALL Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Kasich voted for NAFTA, a disaster for Ohio, and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness! @mazzei48: @realDonaldTrump @BrazielCarol @FoxNews Listening to interview on replay of @A Savage Nation #GO DONALD TRUMP !!!!! Thanks. @wh:  WOW people are so misinformed on DonaldTrump character! Watch this video! Hillary and Bernie don't come close @realwwshelton: @loudobbsnews I believe that @realDonaldTrump will be the big winner tomorrow.  Thank you! @BrazielCarol: @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Who started this mess, the protesters of course . And media made it worse. Sadly, this kind of stuff even happened to Ronald Reagan. There is nothing nice about it! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
 THANK YOU - Youngstown, Ohio! I love you! Get out & #VoteTrump tomorrow. #Trump2016  Kasich has helped decimate the coal and steel industries in Ohio. I will bring them back! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA, which devastated Ohio and is now pushing TPP hard- bad for American workers! Leaving the great people of North Carolina. Amazing event. Heading to Tampa now! #VoteTrump Look forward to being in Tampa this afternoon. Wonderful crowds. Thank you, Florida! We don't have a country- if we don't have borders. #VoteTrump 
Video:   Just received from @PeteRose_14. 
Thank you Pete! #VoteTrump on 
Tuesday Ohio! #Trump2016
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain  LYIN' TED  The failing @nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers. They knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check. Really bad people! Because Gov. Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- & should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue. Carly Fiorina- I agree! Ted Cruz is just another politician. All talk- no action!
 Thank you Kevin. With unification of the party, Republican wins will be massive! 
 Gov.Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television, he only watches the @GolfChannel Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA, from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP, which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying! Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours! @alextrent4: It is repulsive that Trump was assaulted+politicians used that 2 further themselves+2 further victimize Trump! DISGUSTING!! Wow, Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania, not enough signatures. Big problem! Wow, Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania, not enough signatures. Big problem! USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail!  Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core! In other words, education of your children from D.C. No way #EndCommonCore #Trump2016
Video:   Just finished my second speech. 20K in Dayton & 25K in Cleveland- perfectly behaved crowd. Thanks- I love you, Ohio!  It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians! The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump --- and that is fact! We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio. 
No way to run a country! Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco, his State Chairman, & their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote. The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled! 
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 Thank you Dayton, Ohio! 20,000 supporters- largest in airport history! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! On my way to Dayton, Ohio. Will be there soon! The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled. Will be great - love you Ohio! Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U.S. If it were not for striking oil, they would be bust! Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud! Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered. Kasich is good for Mexico! The organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago, have totally energized America! I just got off the phone with the great people of Guam! Thank you for your support! #VoteTrump today! #Trump2016 Great news! Thank you Governor Ralph DLG Torres! #Trump2016   It means so much to me- receiving an endorsement from Phyllis Schlafly. A truly great woman & conservative.  Thank you St. Louis, Missouri!

  Rumor has it that @politico is going out of business. Losing too much money. Great news! Likewise, dopey Mort Zuckerman's @NYDailyNews  Dr. Ben Carson- I concur. 

I believe in God who can change people- he can make any of us better.
@RealBenCarson Thank you! #GOPDebate  @JaredWyand: Let's be clear.. #NeverTrump is about Never someone we don't own You either play into it & let them win or vote Trump. Thank you America! #Trump2016

#LightweightSenatorMarcoRubio  Keep lightweight Marco and his friends out of the White House. 
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016  Phony Club For Growth tried to shake me down for one million dollars, & is now putting out nasty negative ads on me. They are total losers!

I hear @NBCNews / @WSJ came out with another one of their phony polls. While I am leading, they are totally discredited after last S.C. poll The negative television commercials about me, paid for by the politicians bosses, are a total #Mediafraud. When you watch, remember! Hawaii:

 Mitt Romney had his chance and blew it. Lindsey Graham ran for president, got ZERO, and quit! Why are they now spokesmen against me? Sad! Remember, I am the only one who is self-funding my campaign. All of the other candidates are bought and paid for by special interests! Sun Sentinel says: Rubio lacks the experience, work ethic and gravitas needed to be president. HE HAS NOT EARNED YOUR VOTE! @EricTrump: Wishing our father tremendous luck in Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho & Hawaii today! Amazing father!  @Q MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Thank you @EricTrump!  Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho & Hawaii: Get out to VOTE and join the movement today! Video:   The Club for Growth is a very dishonest group. They represent conservative values terribly & are bad for America.  People forget, it was Club for Growth that asked me for $1 million. I said no & they went negative. Extortion!  Ted Cruz Was For Welcoming Syrian Refugees Before He Was Against It
 I employ many people in Hawaii at my great hotel in Honolulu. I’ll be there very soon. Vote for me, Hawaii! Cruz came to Mississippi, there was nobody there, he left the state. I had a rally in Madison, MS with 10,000! 
Thank you! I will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm EST on @FoxNews! Enjoy! New ad concerning lightweight Senator Marco Rubio: 
 Thank you Idaho! I love your potatoes- 
nobody grows them better. As 
President, I will protect your market.  Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio features Trump Univ. students in FL. attack ads- who submitted excellent reviews.  @justin_sellers: Setup is underway @realDonaldTrump rally in Madison. #MSPrimary  Thank you! It was great being in Michigan. Remember, I am the only presidential candidate who will bring jobs back to the U.S.and protect car industry! Don't believe the millions of dollars of phony television ads by lightweight Rubio and the R establishment. Dishonest people! Leaving for North Carolina. Big crowd, will be fun! Congratulation to Adam Scott and all of the folks at Trump National Doral on producing a really great WGC Tournament. Amazing finish! I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. A record no-show in Senate, he is scamming Florida We cannot let the failing REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT, who could not stop Obama twice, ruin the MOVEMENT with millions of  $'s in false ads! Lindsey Graham is all over T.V., much like failed 47% candidate Mitt Romney. These nasty, angry, jealous  failures have ZERO credibility! Failed presidential candidate Lindsey Graham should respect me. I destroyed his run, brought him from 7% to 0% when he got out. Now nasty! How do you fight millions of dollars of fraudulent commercials pushing for crooked politicians? I will be using Facebook & Twitter. Watch! All of the phony T.V. commercials against me are bought and payed for by SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, the bandits that tell your pols what to do @Janetlarose1: @realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @jdickerson WASHINGTON VERSUS TRUMP ❤ &TRUMPS SUPPORTERS ... #TRUMPDOG @ChadRowland3:  @jdickerson @FaceTheNation A solid interview and a fair one. Great job Mr. Trump. Keep up the good work. #TrumpTrain .@meetthepress and @chucktodd did a 1 hour hit job on me today – totally biased and mostly false. Dishonest media! I am at Trump National Doral-best resort in U.S. Rory and Adam Scott are doing great! Watch on NBC at 3:00 P.M.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Thank you to @jdickerson and @FaceTheNation for a very fair and professional interview this morning. No wonder you are #1 in the ratings! Fraud lightweight Marco made a TV ad on TrumpU featuring 2 people who signed these letters: 
 The primary plaintiff in the phony Trump University suit wants to abandon the case. Disgraceful! Nancy Reagan, the wife of a truly great President, was an amazing woman. She will be missed! David Brooks, of the New York Times, is closing in on being the dumbest of them all. He doesn’t have a clue. Thank you Michigan! #Trump2016  FLORIDA: Do not miss this opportunity to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! Thank you @IvankaTrump:   I will be interviewed on @FaceTheNation this morning. Enjoy!  @jdickerson .@FoxNews is devastated that lightweight Senator Marco Rubio got trounced tonight and is the big loser. I won the two big states, great! Thank you Kentucky! #Trump2016

I am watching two clown announcers on @FoxNews as they try to build up failed presidential candidate #LittleMarco. Fox News is in the bag! Romney's failed advisors, like campaign mgr Stuart Stevens are all over TV telling people how to win. But they lost- don't know how to win! .@MittRomney was a disaster candidate who had no guts and choked! Romney is a total joke, and everyone knows it! Thank you, Kansas! The line going into the Orlando event is over a mile long. Massive crowd expected. Leaving Kansas now, be there soon! #CaucusForTrump #Trump2016   Getting ready to make my speech at #KansasCaucus. A great honor! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 Thank you Kansas! Thousands of people inside- and thousands outside who couldn't get into the hall. Really amazing! #CaucusForTrump To the people of Kentucky, 
Rand Paul didn't want you. Now he runs back due to his presidential failure. 
#VoteTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Why would anyone in Kentucky listen to failed presidential candidate Rand Paul re: caucus. Made a fool of himself 1%.
KY his 2nd choice! Will be in Orlando, Florida, this afternoon. 25,000 people expected. This is a movement like our GREAT COUNTRY has never seen before! Wow, big lines in Kansas. For all of today's voters please remember that I am the only candidate that is self funding my campaign, I am not bought and paid for! Great time last night in Louisiana. Big and energetic crowd. Go out and vote now, polls open. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! I am in Kansas. Will be an exciting day. Big speech this morning in Wichita, and then go to caucus. Sorry CPAC the format was fine!.

  MY POSITION ON VISAS
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
  The Better Business Bureau report, with an A rating for Trump University. #GOPDebate   Rubio puts out ad that my pilot was a drug dealer- not true, not my pilot! Guy owned helicopter company- don't think I ever even used. Senator Sessions will serve as the

On NOW! @blt21muttrades: People are just mad that you're doing so good so they are gonna do they're best to stop you. Not gonna happen #MAGA @CreativeXwalk: @realDonaldTrump teaching the GOP how to lose four years ago was not enough. Now Romney wants to do it again. The phony lawsuit against Trump U could have been easily settled by me but I want  to go to court. 98% approval rating by students. Easy win Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago? I am the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton. I am not a Mitt Romney, who doesn't know how to win. Hillary wants no part of Trump Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who, as a Senator, never even shows up to vote - worst record. Marco Rubio is a joke! I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party, while the Dems are going down. Establishment wants to kill this movement! Failed candidate Mitt Romney,who ran one of the worst races in presidential history,is working with the establishment to bury a big R win! @malski1954: I changed parties to vote for you, no one else measures up to you, The GOPe needs a reality check. Our country is at stake Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected. Not a good messenger! Millions of dollars being spent on false TV ads by special interest groups who own Rubio & Cruz.When you see them think of your puppet POLS @Johnsmi01433966: The establishment doesn't like you because they can't control you and get you to lie to us and keep ripping us off. Because of me, the Republican Party has taken in millions of new voters, a record. If they are not careful, they will all leave. Sad! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
Video:   I would love to see the Republican party and everyone get together- and unify.
Video:   Just another desperate move by the man who should have easily beaten Barrack Obama. 2/2 Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney is having a news conference tomorrow to criticize me. 1/2 I am going to repeal and replace ObamaCare! Read more about my positions on healthcare reform here:  .@CNN poll just hit 49% for Trump. Interesting how my numbers have gone so far up since lightweight Marco Rubio has turned nasty. Love it! @HavBat22: @TeamCavuto #KenLangone is 100% correct #NeilCavuto. And u and the rest of u #Fox muppets refuse to HEAR HIM. So true! Why can't the leaders of the Republican Party see that I am bringing in new voters by the millions-we are creating a larger, stronger party! My wife @MELANIATRUMP will be #OnTheRecord w/ @greta tonight at 7pmE on @FoxNews. Enjoy! 
  @KinnardJan: @Itsjoeco @realDonaldTrump I took Trump University class and saved my home! Marco Rubio lost big last night. I even beat him in Virginia, where he spent so much time and money. Now his bosses are desperate and angry! Why would anyone in Florida vote for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. Check out his credit card scam, his house sale & his no show voting! The special interests and people who control our politicians puppets are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent T.V. ads on me. @JoeNBC: FOX calls Virginia for Trump. If it holds, it's a big win for Trump and a big setback for Rubio, who needed to win the state. @JoeNBC: Marco Rubio just criticized Ted Cruz for underperforming tonight. Wow. #SuperTuesday @NorahODonnell: Looks like Rubio won't get any delegates from TX or AL because he didn't meet 20% threshold. @mikiebarb: A nearly impossible path to the GOP nomination for Rubio, says @apalmerdc:  … @danpfeiffer: For the record, most Democrats would much rather face Cruz than Trump  So true!

Landing now! #Trump2016 I will be making a big surprise announcement to the massive crowd assembled in Huntsville/Madison Alabama! Landing now! #Trump2016 Phylis Schlafly: 'Marco Rubio Betrayed Us All'  Little Marco Rubio treated America's ICE officers like absolute trash in order to pass Obama's amnesty.  Little Marco Rubio gave amnesty to criminal aliens guilty of sex offenses. DISGRACE!  Little Marco Rubio is just another Washington D.C. politician that is all talk and no action. #RobotRubio  @EmaGabi23: Rubio was kicking back on his $80k boat he bought with lobbyist money and claimed it was from book sale profit lol Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is polling very poorly in Florida. The people can't stand him for missing so many votes - poor work ethic! Little Marco Rubio, the lightweight no show Senator from Florida is just another Washington politician.  Mitt Romney didn't show his tax return until SEPTEMBER 21, 2012, and then only after being humiliated by Harry R! A bad messenger for estab! As I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke- I disavow.  Why would the people of Texas support Ted Cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them. He is another all talk, no action pol! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016  Little Marco Rubio, the lightweight no show Senator from Florida, is set to be the puppet of the special interest Koch brothers. WATCH! Making a big speech in Alabama today. So many people we had to move to a football stadium! Come and join us! I am the only Republican who will get large numbers of Dems and Indies crossover. I will also get states that no other Republican can get. While Hillary and I both won South Carolina by big margins, Repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cycles.GROWING PARTY The Republican Establishment has been pushing for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio to say anything to hit Trump.I signed the pledge-careful While I hear the Koch brothers are in big financial trouble oil, word is they have chosen little Marco Rubio, the lightweight from Florida @CharlesHodgson1:  A lot more water after this bombshell, Rubio. You are an enemy of America. @realDonaldTrump  @ilduce2016: It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep. – @realDonaldTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain @JimmyTheSaint09: @realDonaldTrump @RonnieMemo @ChrisChristie anything is better than @marcorubio @fairess369: It is a sad commentary little boy Marco Rubio can't win in his home state. Floridians despise him as a opportunist phony. @sprivitor @realDonaldTrump Marco 'Amnesty' Rubio is the front man of Amnesty.  #AlwaysTrump #Trump2016 #TrumpTrain @tiarardis: @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @JudgeJeanine GO TRUMP @RonnieMemo: DonaldTrump is a leader.

Video:   THANK YOU Arkansas! Get out & #VoteTrump on Tuesday. We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN!  Incredibly proud of my son @EricTrump & his efforts on behalf of @StJude in Memphis, TN.   It was an honor to be the Grand Marshall- in the Salute to Israel Parade back in 2004.  Just watched lightweight Marco Rubio lying to a small crowd about my past record. He is not as smart as Cruz, and may be an even bigger liar .#RogerStone was just banned by @CNN - their loss! Tough, loyal guy. I started my business with very little and built it into a great company, with some of the best real estate assets in the World. Amazing! I only wish my wonderful father, Fred, gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says. He didn't - total fabrication! Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version - amazing people! I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz! Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit, no problem! I unfairly get audited by the I.R.S. almost every single year. I have rich friends who never get audited. I wonder why? @NeilTurner_: @realDonaldTrump There's only one real candidate, and it's you! Donors control the other candidates! #VoteTrump Thank you. I will be on @foxandfriends at 8:30 A.M. Will be talking about lightweight Marco Rubio and lying Ted Cruz! @SassyPantsjj: Michigan GOP poll 2/24/2016 Trump 35.5 Rubio 15.0 Cruz 14.3 Kasich 12.8 Carson 8.3 @realDonaldTrump Wow!

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016  They don't like Rubio in Florida- he left them high & dry. Doesn't even show up for votes! Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a choker! Mr. Meltdown. Wow, every poll said I won the debate last night. Great honor! Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material! Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker  Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. They failed! Will be at Fort Worth Texas Convention Center at 11:30 A.M. Big crowd - get there early! Big announcement to be made! Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit! Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday. Cruz is a nasty guy, not one Senate endorsement and, despite talk, gets nothing done. Loser! I will be making a speech at 12:00 in Fort Worth, Texas. Really big crowd expected. Will be talking about the debate last night-plus, plus! @WaltSeher: @realDonaldTrump @morg25016893 @eventbrite yup 200 Polish immigrants were hired by his contractor not Trump @MJP1370: @realDonaldTrump Cruz talks about Hillary all the time because he knows he can't beat you ! Trump will win Texas ! @donell27743094: @realDonaldTrump trump won the debate. Disgusting Rubio said peed - is he still in junior high school. @tdltdltdltdl:  Marco Cruz and Ted Rubio easy to get the two politicians confused looked like desperate, panicked DC insiders tonight @SkylerDeckard: @realDonaldTrump that's because you've never hired anyone to do work before favorite line from tonights debate. @restorereality: Tonight you proved to America you are the real deal. You took fire from all sides, stayed composed, returned fire and WON! @Slytle24: @davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump @CNN he won almost all polls and Mark Halperin gave him an A- @Indies4Trump: Vote Early in the #LoneStarState #SuperTuesday @realDonaldTrump will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  @morg25016893:  @eventbrite Also, all the things Rubio&Cruz were using for hits, just petty. Trump, clearly the only one w/all the skills. Big day in Texas tomorrow! Having a rally in Fort Worth. Tremendous crowd. Will be exciting! #Trump2016  All the online polls have me winning the debate. I really enjoyed the evening. Not easy, but good.  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016  Thank you! #GOPDebate Polls 
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!   Thank you! WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #Trump2016  Failed presidential candidate @MittRomney was made to look like a fool by Senator Harry Reid & didn't release his tax returns until 9/21/12. THANK YOU!  
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
  FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall. He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar! Early on Ted Cruz said that if he didn't win South Carolina, it's over. He didn't win- and lost to me in a landslide! Thank you Illinois! #Trump2016  Join me in Oklahoma tomorrow night!
#MakeYoutubeGreatAgain #Trump2016
 I'm going to do what @MittRomney was totally unable to do- WIN! LETS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Schedule & tickets:   Signing a recent tax return- isn't this ridiculous?  Just for your info, tax returns have 0 to do w/ someone’s net worth. I have already filed my financial statements w/ FEC. They are great! Why doesn’t @MittRomney just endorse @marcorubio already.
Should have done it before NH or Nevada where he had a little sway. Too late
now! Mitt Romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope! Great new poll. Thank you Texas! #VoteTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  @ChatteringTeef: @BornToBeGOP @realDonaldTrump @MittRomney hates to see Trump's success when he was so pathetic @classyexplorer:  @ahernandez85a Romney is a pawn of the Establishment and has no individual thought process. He is jealous of Trump! @conservativevin:  @ahernandez85a Romney should have been a tough guy with Obama. He cowered and lost. BADLY! He's not relevant! @Stevekwebb: @realDonaldTrump Love it! @tedcruz is done. We need someone who is proven. @realDonaldTrump will make America Great Again @Ausbiz: @realDonaldTrump Trump is so impressive and no other politician has his passion & energy to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain @HosierN: @foxnewspolitics A vote for @tedcruz or @marcorubio is a vote for corruption, special interests and lobbyists. Trump for POTUS! @ahernandez85a: @realdonaldtrump Mr Tough Guy Romney should be backing Trump like Trump backed him last time #NoLoyalty Ted Cruz is lying again. Polls are showing that I do beat Hillary Clinton head to head. Check out  Poll snd Q Poll. Texas, Georgia & many more VOTE EARLY! This is a movement!
#Trump2016 VOTE VIDEO:   @GriceCindy: That's why we are angry. The Republican Establishment will not support you. You are who the American people want! @ddpick18: @realDonaldTrump This Texan will be voting Trump March 1st. Cruz is a fake Texan! .@RepChrisCollins  Chris, thank you so much for your wonderful endorsement. I will not let you down! @CNN When Ted Cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear, I will get most of his votes - no problem! Why would Texans vote for liar Ted Cruz when he was born in Canada, lived there for 4 years-and remained a Canadian citizen until recently When Mitt Romney asked me for my endorsement last time around, he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win! @Ward_II: Oh great @MittRomney is doing a @SenatorReid on @realDonaldTrump like losing the presidency wasn't enough #Trump2016 He's a fool Mitt Romney,who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool, is now playing tough guy The polls show that I picked up many Jeb Bush supporters. That is how I got to 46%. When others drop out, I will pick up more.  Sad but true MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  In all of television- the only one who said anything bad about last nights landslide victory-- was dopey @KarlRove. He should be fired! I am in Virginia @RegentU Presidential forum with Dr. Pat Robertson- beginning now! Watch here:  I am self funding my campaign & don't owe anybody anything! I only owe it to the American people! #Trump2016
Watch:  .@USATODAY Poll and @QuinnipiacPoll say that I beat both Hillary and Bernie, and I havn't even started on them yet!

  Club for Growth is the group that came to my office seeking $1 million dollars. I told them no and now they are doing negative ads. Great. Just reported on @FoxNews that many people who supported @JebBush are now supporting me. I knew that would happen, pundits didn't! Wow, great Ohio poll. Shows me leading by 5 points, beating K!

#NevadaCaucus #VoteTrumpNV 
 @StevenMeyers11: @Vogelsong1 @EdRollins @FoxNews Ed Rollins is the only one of those people that understands process & gets it right I am growing the Republican Party tremendously - just look at the numbers, way up! Democrats numbers are significantly down from years past. @jojo2foxy: TRUMP IS UNSTOPPABLE....HE IS WHAT COMMON SENSE AMERICANS WANT WHETHER REPUBLICAN, INDEPENDENT OR A REAGAN DEMOCRAT. @Vogelsong1: @EdRollins gets it. Was just on @FoxNews explaining how Trump wins the general election.  Thank you Ed! Ted Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again! The Evangelicals in S.C. figured him out & said no! Ted Cruz does not have the right temperment to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD! Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog! Ted panicked. Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration. THANK YOU LAS VEGAS, NEVADA!

Simon Poll/SIU I will be on @seanhannity tonight- from Las Vegas, Nevada at 10pmE. Enjoy! #Hannity #Trump2016  Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa. Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen! Sad. Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false, more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy? Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support! Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics! Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks! It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve, and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done. Thank you for your endorsement @paulteutulsr! #BikersForTrump #VoteTrumpNV Video:   Many people are now saying I won South Carolina because of the last debate. I showed anger and the people of our country are very angry! @SandraR677582: @FLTrumpTeam Florida starts early voting on March 5 extending to March 15. Absentee ballots have been sent out! #Trump2016 @ScotMReed: No matter what liar sleazeball @rickwtyler says about @tedcruz in Tennessee. We have early voting and @realDonaldTrump has won. I hear the Rickets family, who own the Chicago Cubs, are secretly spending $'s against me. They better be careful, they have a lot to hide! @1sonny12: @KSmith233035 @mitchellvii  FLORIDIANS ARE UPSET BECAUSE RUBIO DID NOT DO WHAT HE PROMISED ONCE HE WAS ELECTED! VOTE TRUMP @gregusp61: You really rocked them hard in S.C. Rubio and Cruz were pummled. So glad Jeb is gone! Next no liar! The reason that Ted Cruz lost the Evangelicals in S.C. is because he is a world class LIAR, and Evangelicals do not like liars! I am in Las Vegas, at the best hotel by far, Trump International. I will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to WIN Nevada! @EricTrump: Nevada we are on our way! #VoteTrumpNV #Trump2016 Caucus locator:   A number of months ago, I was not expected to win South Carolina,Ted Cruz was, and yet I won in a landslide - every group and category. WIN! THANK YOU Atlanta, Georgia! Leaving for Nevada now. Lets MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!   Thank you South Carolina!   A quote was read from a parody account last night on MSNBC re: Jeb.   The failing @WSJ Wall Street Journal should fire both its pollster and its Editorial Board. Seldom has a paper been so wrong.Totally biased! I will be live on all of the major morning talk shows. Enjoy! Thank you @SarahPalinUSA for your amazing help and support. Big win, leaving now for Atlanta and Nevada.The people of South Carolina got it! @mikeliberation: This is the best reaction shot I've ever seen lol #Trump2016  What a great night. Thank you South Carolina, a special place with truly amazing people! LOVE People pundits gave me no chance in South Carolina. Now it looks like a possible win. I would be happy with a one vote victory! HOPE @CarrollKuykend2: This veteran just voted @realDonaldTrump in the SC primary, let's make America great again! South Carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands. Vote now today, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Remember that Marco Rubio is very weak on illegal immigration. South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in. Don't allow it I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go! @Carolyn82471448: @WayneDupreeShow @realDonaldTrump All aboard the Trump Train! @JoeNBC: Trump expressed concerns months after the Iraq War began, while 60% of Americans still supported the war.  I am the only candidate in many years who is self-funding his campaign.

I am the only one who will #MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN! I’m self-funding and I am going to take care of the people – not the special interests and insurance companies like the other candidates. I will replace it with private plans, health savings accounts, & allow purchasing across state lines. Maximum choice & freedom for consumer. I was referring to a backstop for pre-existing conditions. I will eliminate the law, in its entirety, & replace it w/ something much better. I was asked about healthcare by Anderson Cooper & have been consistent- I will repeal all of #ObamaCare, including the mandate, period.

#SCPrimary #Trump2016  Join us tomorrow night in Charleston, South Carolina! #SCPrimary #Trump2016  Response to the Pope:
 I agree with Marco Rubio that Ted Cruz is a liar! .@FoxNews is changing their  theme from fair and balanced to unfair and unbalanced. But dying @WSJ is worse.Their phony poll is a  joke! Thank you South Carolina! Together, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #VoteTrumpSC  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016  Thank you America! #Trump2016
  New CBS National Poll just out - massive lead for Trump. The Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll is a total joke. No wonder WSJ is doing so badly! I love being in South Carolina. We are leading big in all of the State polls - Saturday is a BIG day. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The just out USA Today National Poll, where I lead by big numbers, shows that in a head to head matchup, I beat both Hillary and Bernie. Amazing that while I lead by big numbers in the new Q and and USA Today polls, the the press only wants to report on the phony WSJ/NBC poll. Join us tomorrow in Kiawah, South Carolina! #SCPrimary #VoteTrumpSC
#Trump2016 
 THANK YOU AMERICA! 
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016  Thank you Nevada! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016  Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool, but it's far too late. 1% in Nevada! Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1%, he should take his dumb mouthpiece, @LindseyGrahamSC, and just go home. .@FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting. They do not want Trump to win. All negative! I will beat Hillary easily, but Lindsey Graham says I won't, and yet he got zero against me- no cred! Why does FOX put him on? .@lindseygraham, who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on @FoxNews. Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I would never be president - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history! @ChJLuc91: @YomasterJon @RichardTBurnett  Scary how smoothly Cruz looks into the camera and lies about Trump, CANT be #POTUS! #Trump2016 @babo_sirin: BUSTED AGAIN: @TedCruz in Hot Water Over Possibly Illegal Fundraising #SCPrimary  The guy is bad news Why does @megynkelly devote so much time on her shows to me, almost always negative?  Without me her ratings would tank. Get a life Megyn! @debdew2:  @brithume @megynkelly @DiamondandSilk FOX: TRUMP HATERS R SCARED BECAUSE THEY LOSE -  TRUMP IS WINNING  Thank you  @kayleighmcenany for your nice words - great knowledge and style! We are doing really well in South Carolina. @CNN @donlemon @Good2bqueen67:  @brithume @megynkelly They're too lame to get it, Sir. When you win the election they'll get it. .@brithume thinks that when Republicans drop out of the race, someone will pick up ALL of that vote. The fact is I will get much of it! Explain to @brithume and @megynkelly, who know nothing, that I will beat Hillary and win states and dem-indie votes that no other R can! Will be interviewed by @StephenAtHome tonight by phone- a late show first @CBS @colbertlateshow. Enjoy! 
#Colbert #LSSC Thank you, South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016  Thank you to the 2,500+ in North Augusta, South Carolina. Lines down the block!

VOTE on Saturday! #VoteTrumpSC  Thank you for your continued support!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain  RESPONSE TO THE LIES OF SENATOR CRUZ: 
#Trump2016 #VoteTrumpSC JEB is a hypocrite! Used massive private Eminent Domain --- Just another clueless politician! 
 Jeb used Eminent Domain & took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. 2/2
 I'd like to call JEB a liar, but the truth is he has no clue & never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! 1/2 Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb!, is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center, Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful! I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG, BIG, BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates, Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada Funny that Jeb! didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy, now brother! Ted Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn't! Wow, in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you! Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests - the bosses! Loved the debate last night, and almost everyone said I won, but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors & special ints Thank you for your support! TOGETHER we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
  I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning. Enjoy! This shows what a complete & total liar Ted Cruz is- he said he wouldn't have nominated John Roberts. Really?  @autumnandews08: @realDonaldTrump @JebBush Jeb is incompetent and will lose, don't waste your energy on that cry baby! Even though every poll, Time, Drudge etc., has me winning the debate by a lot, @FoxNews only puts negative people on. Biased - a total joke! @jeffpaine:  @realDonaldTrump you crushed the debate! Thank you! #GOPDebate #GoogleTrends  Hey @glennbeck- see how I beat your boy Ted- in your own Blaze poll? Your endorsement means nothing! #GOPDebate #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!  All polls have me winning debate big- Drudge, TIME, etc. Dopey Charles Krauthammer still nasty. He has zero cred- totally dishonest! How can @JebBush beat Hillary Clinton- if he can't beat anyone else on the #GOPDebate stage with $150M? I am the only one who can! Thank you! I miss my father.   Lightweight @JebBush said tonight he didn't know his family used private eminent domain in Texas- Lie! 
#GOPDebate On the way to the #GOPDebate with my wonderful wife @MelaniaTrump.
  Ted Cruz is a cheater! He holds the Bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts! Nasty Ted Cruz is at it again- same dirty tricks he used w/ @RealBenCarson- saying I may not be on ballot & I hold liberal positions. LIES! Wow! Honored to be chosen by the highly respected + accurate Washington & Lee Mock Convention. I hope you are right - I will make you proud! The totally unexpected loss of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a massive setback for the Conservative movement and our COUNTRY! Love the people of South Carolina - look very much forward to the debate tonight. @AmFree: #Trump On #Ford, #Carrier, Shipping #Jobs To #Mexico: ‘I’m The Only One Who Understands What’s Going On’  @ThtsWhtKelSaid: I'm fed up w/ DC playing 3 card Monty w/ our tax $'s. It's time we the people play the Trump card, & take back our country @BrandonSawyer84: @realDonaldTrump will rule #SouthCarolinaPrimary!  @wino911:  #Trump2016 We know better than to trust the RNC    So cute! Thank you, South Carolina! We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN!
  Get on Trump's List email from the RNC was not authorized. I am self funding my campaign! Do not pay. 
Email:  @grammies28: @realDonaldTrump was right! Vote trump! Bring our jobs back.   I told you so, only going to get worse @Elvisfan1976: @NRSC stop sending me emails asking me to donate and get a free DonaldTrump sticker. I support him and he's self funding! @dj4k4000: @realDonaldTrump @CNN Trump will be our next POTUS..every American will benefit positivey from this. @nellalda: @DonaldJTrump45 @realDonaldTrump @Reince They are all going crazy! We the people do not care at all! We are with Trump!! @Bonfiredesigns: @StellaDean Let's Get United In America With @realDonaldTrump  A very big thank you to Bill Donohue, head of The Catholic League, for the wonderful interview on @CNN and article in Newsmax! Great insight Totally unauthorized, do not pay. I am self funding my campaign! Notice has just been withdrawn. #Trump2016
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain The RNC, which is probably not on my side, just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying Trump wants you to contribute to the RNC. Now an additional 600-700 jobs in America 2,000 being eliminated for move to Mexico- via Hartford Courant.  @jd4160: Nice column by Bill Donahue, head of Catholic League. He's a blue collar New Yorker and gets it  I am the only one who can fix this. Very sad. Will not happen under my watch! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
 Just got back from Tampa. It was an amazing evening with an even more amazing crowd - fantastic people! Will be in South Carolina tomorrow. Word is that little Morty Zuckerman’s @NYDailyNews loses more than $50 million per year---can that be possible? When little Morty Zuckerman closes his failing @NYDailyNews will I at least be given some credit? Will happen soon. 11,000 inside venue tonight in Tampa! Broke record set by Elton John in 1988 w/out musical instruments! Another 5,000 outside. Will be back! I will end illegal immigration and protect our borders! We need to MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN! #Trump2016
 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!  Millions of $'s of false ads,  paid for by lobbyists-special interests of cheater @SenTedCruz  and sleepy @JebBush, are now running in S.C. @copyover2001: @realDonaldTrump   Do Americans really want a Canadian-born president? First non native born in history? @by @tedcruz good I want to see the court decide what I was always told natural born means - born on American soil @hillx123: @tedcruz you have just been put on notice @realDonaldTrump We Stand with you... #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Thankyou. Last time lightweight @JebBush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself. If he doesn't do better this time, he is out! If @TedCruz doesn’t clean up his act, stop cheating, & doing negative ads, I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen. Lightweight @JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC. False advertising- desperate and sad! After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me, they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect & ill-informed ads. Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution, which naturally, they did not get. You must be registered Republican by February 16th to vote TRUMP in the Florida primary. 
 The failing @NYDailyNews, destroyed by little Morty Zuckerman, is preparing to close and save face by going online. It's dead! NEVADA! Tomorrow is the deadline to register Republican.

Message from @IvankaTrump:  How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest? Lying Cruz put out a statement, Trump & Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage. Cruz is the worst liar, crazy or very dishonest. Perhaps all 3? Weak JEB getting thrown out by management during speech. Do you think he will be this tough on Putin & others?   THANK YOU- Baton Rouge, Louisiana! WE will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! #Trump2016  Just landed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Reports are out that lines are three quarters of a mile to get in. Wow! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Cruz caught cold in lie after denial of push polls like lies w/ @RealBenCarson. How can he preach Christian values?  @truthinvest: @CNN @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Ted Cruz is the definition of sleaze. Just ask @RealBenCarson Heading to Baton Rouge, Louisiana for a speech. Expecting a very large crowd! See you soon. #Trump2016 
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest pushpolls on me. We are watching! Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother who got us into the quicksand of Iraq. Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance! He or she who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Remember, it was the Republican Party, with the help of Conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT .@MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word, left an open blank. Please apologize! Jeb Bush spent more than $40,000,000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5, I spent $3,000,000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability! There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser! I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local! THANK YOU- Clemson, South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #SCPrimary  @HARyder: Which is it @realDonaldTrump ?Are you planning on getting rid of Common Core or keeping it?  Get rid of it fast. I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core. Big speech tonight in South Carolina - 7:00 P.M. Tremendous crowd! So funny, Jeb Bush called me a highly gifted politician and a great entertainer - I assume that is a compliment! Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today. Like the worthless @NYDailyNews, looks like @politico will be going out of business. Bad reporting- no money, no cred! Worthless @NYDailyNews, which dopey Mort Zuckerman, is desperately trying to sell, has no buyer! Liabilities are massive! Dopey Mort Zuckerman, owner of the worthless @NYDailyNews, has a major inferiority complex. Paper will close soon! @MarkHalperin: My report card grades for the 2 New Hampshire winners: DonaldTrump A: v strong energy/close. BernieSanders B+: went too long Thank you to the people of  New Hampshire, I love you! Now, off to South Carolina. Thank you, New Hampshire! Departing with my amazing family now! #FITN #NHPrimary
  We will stop heroin and other drugs from coming into New Hampshire from our open southern border. We will build a WALL and have security. We will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare - and nobody can do that like me. We will save $'s and have much better healthcare! ISIS is making big threats today - no respect for U.S.A. or our leader - If I win it will be a very different story,with very fast results New Hampshire vote today -  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #FITN  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:40. A.M. Enjoy! The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION. States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me. Great! No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so! I know the Governors and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain! Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE education from D.C. and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION come as act of love. Not a leader! Thank you, New Hampshire! #FITN  Thank you, New Hampshire! 
#FITN #NHPrimary #VoteTrumpNH  
Voting questions?   #VoteTrumpNH #NHPrimary #FITN
 Now that Bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign, he says he would end super PACs. Sad! Today's third stop- Londonderry, New Hampshire! Thank you!
#FITN #VoteTrumpNH  America needs strong leadership. Politicians can talk but they don’t get things done. Video:   Everybody is laughing at Jeb Bush-spent $100 million and is at bottom of pack. A pathetic figure! Jeb Bush is desperate - strongly in favor of #CommonCore and very weak on illegal immigration. Thank you for your support at this mornings Town Hall- in Salem, New Hampshire. #FITN #NHPrimary  Jeb Bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a Super Bowl ad. He is a weak candidate! My two wonderful sons, Don and Eric, will be on @foxandfriends at 7:02 - now! Enjoy. So far the Super Bowl is very boring - not nearly as exciting as politics - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! I am in New Hampshire having a great time! Loved the #GOPDebate last night! Everybody enjoy the Super Bowl. #SuperBowlSunday #SB50 Thank you- Plymouth, New Hampshire! #FITN #NHPrimary  Thank you Newt!
